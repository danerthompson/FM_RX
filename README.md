This is the codebase for a *mostly* analog FM radio receiver. The digital parts of the receiver are an SiLabs Si5351 PLL to 
generate LO frequencies and a Nuvoton NAU8810YG audio codec to drive speakers, provide EQ and volume control, etc. Both digital 
components are controlled by an ESP32-S3, which this codebase is for.

Also included in this repo is the schematic used for the board. I can provide the PCB files if desired, but the schematic 
is likely a better reference for anyone wanting to recreate this project.

Feel free to shoot any questions about this project. - Dane
